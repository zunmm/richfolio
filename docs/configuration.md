# Configuration

Richfolio uses a single JSON configuration for all portfolio data — your portfolio stays private.

---

## Setup

Go to your fork's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Variables** tab → create a variable called `CONFIG_JSON` with the JSON content below.

## Example

```json
{
  "targetPortfolio": {
    "VOO": 20,
    "QQQ": 15,
    "GLD": 10,
    "BSV": 20,
    "SMH": 5,
    "BTC": 1.5
  },
  "currentHoldings": {
    "AAPL": 30,
    "VOO": 1,
    "BTC": 0.0002
  },
  "watching": ["MSFT", "NVDA", "AMD"],
  "totalPortfolioValue": 50000,
  "defaultCurrency": "USD",
  "intradayAlerts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "confidenceIncreaseThreshold": 10
  }
}
```

## Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `targetPortfolio` | Yes | Target allocation percentages. Keys are ticker symbols, values are percentages that should sum to ~100%. |
| `currentHoldings` | Yes | Number of shares you currently own. Can include stocks not in your target (e.g., AAPL for ETF overlap detection). |
| `watching` | No | Array of tickers tracked but **not** in your target portfolio. Get fetched, scored by AI, and surfaced in a separate "Watch List" section — without polluting allocation maths. See [Watch List](#watch-list) below. |
| `totalPortfolioValue` | Yes | Your estimated total portfolio value (in `defaultCurrency`). Used for allocation math when actual holdings are smaller than the target. |
| `defaultCurrency` | No | ISO 4217 currency code (e.g. `"USD"`, `"GBP"`, `"AUD"`). Default: `"USD"`. All amounts in emails/Telegram render in this currency; non-matching tickers are FX-converted via live Yahoo Finance rates. |
| `intradayAlerts` | No | Intraday alert settings (see below). Defaults apply if omitted. |

---

## Intraday Alerts

The `intradayAlerts` section controls when intraday checks send alerts. All fields are optional — sensible defaults apply.

Alerts trigger only for STRONG BUY-related changes:
1. **Upgraded to STRONG BUY** — any other level → STRONG BUY
2. **Downgraded from STRONG BUY** — STRONG BUY → any other level
3. **Confidence changed** — confidence shifted ≥ threshold while staying STRONG BUY

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master toggle. Set `false` to disable intraday alerts entirely. |
| `confidenceIncreaseThreshold` | `10` | Minimum confidence change (absolute, percentage points) to trigger an alert for STRONG BUY tickers. |

---

## Refresh Analysis

Re-analyze a single ticker with the latest price (including after-hours/pre-market). Sends email + Telegram with a new analysis URL.

Actions → Portfolio Monitor → **Run workflow** → mode: `refresh`, ticker: `SMH`.

Yahoo Finance's `postMarketPrice` and `preMarketPrice` are used when available. Falls back to regular market price if after-hours data isn't available.

---

## Watch List

The optional `watching` array tracks tickers you want **scored and surfaced as signals** but don't want in your target portfolio. They get fetched, prompted, and scored alongside portfolio tickers, but bypass all the allocation-based rules.

**Use it when:**

- You're researching a stock before committing to a target weight
- You want recommendations on names you don't currently own (e.g. *"is now a good time to start a position in NVDA?"*)
- You want signals on tickers without inflating your portfolio totals over 100%

### How watch tickers differ from portfolio tickers

| Behaviour | Portfolio ticker | Watch ticker |
|---|---|---|
| Counts toward allocation % | Yes | **No** |
| Allocation gap calculated | Yes | **No** |
| `gap ≥ 2%` required for STRONG BUY | Yes | **No** — STRONG BUY needs signal confluence instead |
| Overweight-position guard applies | Yes | **No** |
| Counts against max-2 STRONG BUY cap | Yes | **No** — surfaces every qualifying watch STRONG BUY |
| `suggestedBuyValue` populated | Yes (based on gap) | **Always 0** — you size manually |
| Rendered in main "AI Buy Recommendations" section | Yes | No — separate "Watch List" section |
| Limit price suggested | Yes | Yes (same logic) |
| Detailed STRONG BUY analysis page | Yes | Yes |

### Watch STRONG BUY criteria

Because there's no allocation gap to anchor on, watch tickers need stronger signal confluence to earn a STRONG BUY:

- ≥1 price-level signal (P/E below historical avg, 52-week position < 30%, or price below 200-day MA)
- ≥2 momentum signals confirming the price-level signal (RSI < 35, bullish MACD crossover, Bollinger %B < 0.15, Stochastic %K < 20, OBV rising)
- No major red flags
- Confidence ≥ 80% based on signal confluence alone
- Value rating A or B (for stocks; ETFs and crypto skip this)

### Example

```json
{
  "targetPortfolio": { "VOO": 20, "GLD": 10, ... },
  "currentHoldings": { "VOO": 5, "AAPL": 30 },
  "watching": ["MSFT", "NVDA", "AMD", "AVGO"]
}
```

This portfolio holds AAPL + VOO and tracks MSFT/NVDA/AMD/AVGO purely as research signals. Watch tickers appear in their own email/Telegram section, never push the portfolio total over 100%, and don't crowd portfolio STRONG BUYs.

## Ticker Formats

| Type | Format | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| US stocks/ETFs | Standard symbol | `AAPL`, `VOO`, `QQQ`, `SMH` |
| Crypto | Short name | `BTC`, `ETH` (auto-converted to `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`) |
| International | Yahoo Finance symbol | `0700.HK` (Tencent), `TM` (Toyota) |

## Tips

- **Target percentages** should add up to 100%. If they don't, gap calculations still work but may suggest larger or smaller buys.

- **Holdings outside your target** are tracked for ETF overlap detection. For example, holding AAPL reduces the buy priority for ETFs that contain AAPL (like VOO or QQQ).

- **Fractional shares** are supported — useful for crypto (`"BTC": 0.000188`) or brokers that support fractional stock purchases.

- **Portfolio value** uses the higher of your actual holdings value or the configured estimate. This keeps gap calculations meaningful when you're still building toward your target allocation.

Richfolio works best with a focused portfolio. While there's no hard-coded limit, the free-tier API quotas and digest readability set practical boundaries.

**Recommended ranges:**

| Range | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| **10–20** | Sweet spot — focused, actionable, all free tiers comfortable |
| **20–30** | Still good — manageable digest, well within limits |
| **30–50** | Works technically, but the daily digest gets noisy |
| **50+** | Not recommended (see below) |

**Why 50+ tickers is not recommended:**

- **NewsAPI (100 req/day)** — news is fetched in batches of 5 tickers. Running daily + intraday with 50 tickers uses ~22 calls; at 100 tickers it's ~42, leaving little room for refreshes.
- **AI analysis quality** — Gemini produces more diluted recommendations when evaluating too many options at once.
- **Digest readability** — email gets long and Telegram truncates at 4,096 characters. The signal-to-noise ratio drops sharply.
- **Execution time** — each ticker requires Yahoo Finance calls for price, technicals, and fundamentals, slowing down your GitHub Actions run.

Gemini free tier (250 req/day, 250K tokens/min) is generous and is unlikely to be the bottleneck — even 100 tickers only uses ~53K tokens per run. The real constraints are NewsAPI quota and information overload.

**TL;DR — aim for ≤30 tickers for the best experience on all free tiers.**

## Updating

When your holdings change, update the `CONFIG_JSON` variable with the new JSON content (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab).
