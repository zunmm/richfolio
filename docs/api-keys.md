# API Keys

Richfolio uses up to 5 external services, all with generous free tiers. Only Resend and a recipient email are required — everything else is optional.

Add each key as a repository Secret: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Secrets** tab. Add `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` as a **Variable** instead (easier to view/edit).

## Resend (Email) — Required
{: .text-green-200}

Resend delivers the HTML email reports.

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the dashboard
3. Click **Create API Key**, give it a name, and copy the key
4. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `RESEND_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Free tier:** 3,000 emails/month. Sends from `onboarding@resend.dev` by default. Can only send to your **account owner email** unless you verify a custom domain (Dashboard → Domains → Add Domain → add DNS records).

---

## Recipient Email — Required
{: .text-green-200}

Add as a GitHub **Variable** (not Secret): name: `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, value: your email address.

Must match your Resend account email unless you've verified a custom domain.

---

## NewsAPI (Headlines) — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Provides top headlines per ticker for the daily brief.

1. Go to [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and sign up
2. Your API key is shown on the dashboard immediately
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `NEWS_API_KEY`, value: the key from the dashboard

**Free tier:** 100 requests/day. Richfolio uses ~4 requests per run via batching. Headlines from the last 24 hours only. If not set, the brief runs without news.

## AI Providers — at least one required for AI recommendations

Richfolio supports two AI providers: **Google Gemini** and **Anthropic Claude**. Set at least one for AI-powered recommendations. Set **both** to run them in parallel — scores are then averaged and a per-AI breakdown is shown next to every recommendation. If neither is set, Richfolio falls back to gap-based recommendations (no AI).

| Mode | Setup | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **No AI** | Neither key set | Gap-based recommendations only |
| **Single AI** | One key set | Identical to today — one set of action + confidence per ticker |
| **Multi-AI** | Both keys set | Per-ticker consensus action + averaged confidence; per-AI breakdown shown beneath each rec; STRONG BUY requires unanimous agreement |

---

## Google Gemini — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Powers the AI buy recommendations with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Click **Create API Key**, select a Google Cloud project (or create one)
3. Copy the key and add as a GitHub Secret — name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Free tier:** 250 requests/day, 10 requests/minute. Richfolio uses 2 requests per run (Stage 1 Observe + Stage 2 Decide) plus 1 per STRONG BUY ticker for detailed analysis. New keys may take a few minutes for quota to activate (you might see 429 errors initially).

### A note on Gemini model tiers

Google's pricing page states that Gemini 2.5 Pro is ["Free of charge"](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing#gemini-2.5-pro) for both input and output tokens. In practice, however, free-tier Pro requests frequently hit `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors — even with minimal usage. Google does not publish the actual RPD (requests per day) limits for the free tier; third-party sources suggest Pro may be capped at ~100 RPD, but the real number appears to vary by account and is not guaranteed.

**Richfolio uses Gemini 2.5 Flash by default** because Flash has a more generous and reliable free-tier quota. The quality difference for financial analysis text is negligible.

---

## Anthropic Claude — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Powers the AI buy recommendations with Claude (Sonnet 4.6 by default).

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and sign up
2. Navigate to **API Keys** → **Create Key**, give it a name, copy the key
3. Add as a GitHub Secret — name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, value: the key you just copied

**Pricing:** Anthropic does not have a permanent free tier like Gemini, but new accounts receive a small starter credit and Sonnet usage for Richfolio's workload is typically cents per day. To minimise cost, set `CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (the Haiku tier is significantly cheaper while still handling this workload well).

### Combining with Gemini (multi-AI mode)

If both `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are set, Richfolio runs both providers concurrently on every analysis and aggregates the results:

- **Consensus action** per ticker via majority vote (with confidence-sum tiebreaker)
- **Averaged confidence** displayed prominently; per-AI scores shown beneath
- **STRONG BUY requires unanimous agreement** — if any provider dissents, the consensus caps at BUY
- **Agreement label** (unanimous / majority / split) shown as a badge next to the action

If a provider fails mid-run (rate-limited, quota exhausted, network error), the surviving provider continues alone and the email/Telegram for that run falls back to single-AI display.

### Choosing which provider generates the detailed STRONG BUY analysis page

When both providers are active, the per-STRONG-BUY analysis page (the "More Details" link) is generated by a single provider — by default the first available one in registry order (Gemini, then Claude). Override with:

| Env var | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | Force Gemini for detailed analysis (must have GEMINI_API_KEY set) |
| `AI_DETAILED_PROVIDER` | `claude` | Force Claude for detailed analysis (must have ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Override Claude model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`) |

## Telegram Bot — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Delivers condensed summaries to your Telegram account.

### Create the bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name (e.g., "Richfolio Brief") and username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `richfolio_brief_bot`)
4. BotFather replies with your bot token — copy it

### Get your chat ID

1. Search for **@userinfobot** on Telegram and start it
2. It replies with your numeric user ID — this is your chat ID

**Important:** Send any message to your new bot (e.g., "hi") before running Richfolio — this is required before the bot can message you.

Add both as GitHub Secrets:

- Name: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, value: the token from BotFather
- Name: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, value: your numeric user ID

**Notes:** If not set, the brief skips Telegram. Messages are condensed summaries (not full HTML). 4,096 character limit per message — news is truncated if needed.

## Social Posting — Optional
{: .text-yellow-200}

Richfolio can publish generic buy signals to public accounts on X, Facebook, Threads, and LinkedIn. Every platform is optional and stays off until configured. Required secrets per platform:

- **Facebook:** `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`, `FACEBOOK_PAGE_TOKEN`
- **Threads:** `THREADS_USER_ID`, `THREADS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (+ optional `THREADS_TOKEN_PAT` to auto-refresh the ~60-day token)
- **LinkedIn:** `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `LINKEDIN_ORG_URN`
- **X/Twitter:** `X_API_KEY`, `X_API_SECRET`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

**Notes:** Posts are generic — no holdings or allocations are disclosed. If unset, social posting is skipped. See [Social Posting](social-setup) for step-by-step setup of each platform.
