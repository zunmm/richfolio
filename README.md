## Who Should Use This

Richfolio **does not pick stocks for you**. You should already have your own research and investment thesis — your own portfolio of stocks, ETFs, or crypto that you believe in.

What Richfolio does is **monitor your portfolio daily** and help you decide **when** to buy. It tracks prices, technicals, news sentiment, and allocation gaps, then uses AI to surface the best timing opportunities across your holdings.

- **You bring the portfolio** — set your target allocations once in a simple JSON config
- **Richfolio brings the signals** — buy recommendations, limit order prices, and detailed analysis
- **You make the final call** — every purchase decision is yours; the tool only suggests

**No coding skill required.** Fork the repo, spend ~10 minutes registering free API accounts (Resend, NewsAPI, Gemini), paste your keys into GitHub Settings, and you're done. Everything runs automatically via GitHub Actions at $0/month.

## Features

- **Two-Stage AI Analysis** — Gemini-powered Think/Plan framework: Stage 1 extracts structured observations (signals, risks, summaries), Stage 2 applies decision rules to produce ranked recommendations with confidence scores. Inspired by [OpenAlice](https://github.com/TraderAlice/OpenAlice)'s cognitive architecture. STRONG BUY tickers get a **"More Details"** link to a dedicated analysis page with interactive chart, buy thesis, risk analysis, and full metrics
- **Earnings Calendar Guard** — automatically detects upcoming earnings dates and caps recommendations (≤3 days → HOLD, ≤7 days → no STRONG BUY) to avoid asymmetric risk
- **Post-AI Guard Pipeline** — 6 programmatic safety checks validate every AI recommendation before delivery: bond ETF caps, earnings proximity, STRONG BUY criteria enforcement, max 2 STRONG BUY limit, confidence sanity, and buy value sanity
- **Value Investing Framework** — AI rates individual stocks A–D based on ROE, debt/equity, FCF, earnings growth, and analyst targets (data from Yahoo Finance, zero extra API calls)
- **Bottom-Fishing Model** — AI detects oversold/accumulation zones for all tickers using RSI, volume contraction, 200MA position, and death cross signals
- **Technical Momentum Signals** — SMA50, SMA200, RSI(14), MACD (crossover + histogram), Bollinger Bands (%B + squeeze detection), ATR (volatility), Stochastic (%K/%D oversold/overbought), OBV (accumulation/distribution trend), golden/death cross, and momentum classification for each ticker
- **News Sentiment Scoring** — Gemini scores each headline's sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral) and impact (high/medium/low), providing per-ticker overall sentiment to the AI analysis
- **Reasoning Persistence** — 7-day rolling history of AI conviction per ticker, showing the AI how its own recommendations evolved over time to identify trend momentum
- **Limit Order Prices** — AI-suggested limit order prices based on nearby support levels (moving averages, recent lows, round numbers)
- **Allocation Gap Analysis** — current vs target %, flagged by priority with suggested buy amounts
- **Dynamic P/E Signals** — trailing P/E compared against historical averages fetched from Yahoo Finance (no manual benchmarks needed)
- **ETF Overlap Detection** — reduces buy priority for ETFs where you already hold overlapping stocks (e.g., holding AAPL reduces VOO's priority)
- **52-Week Range Signals** — highlights tickers near their 52-week low (opportunity) or high (caution)
- **News Digest** — top headlines per ticker from NewsAPI
- **Portfolio Health** — weighted beta, estimated annual dividend income
- **Intraday Alerts** — periodic checks that alert only when buy signals strengthen vs the morning brief (configurable thresholds)
- **Weekly Rebalancing Report** — focused drift analysis with BUY/TRIM/OK actions
- **Dual Delivery** — dark-themed HTML email via Resend + condensed Telegram message

## Quick Start

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub
2. **Add config** — go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - **Variables** tab: `CONFIG_JSON` (portfolio config) + `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` (your email)
   - **Secrets** tab: `RESEND_API_KEY` — for email delivery
   - Optionally: `NEWS_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` and/or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (set both for multi-AI mode — scores averaged with per-AI breakdown), `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
3. **Run** — trigger manually from Actions → Portfolio Monitor → Run workflow, or wait for the daily cron (8am AEST)

That's it — no local setup required. See the [full setup guide](https://furic.github.io/richfolio/getting-started) for detailed instructions on each API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furic/richfolio.git
cd richfolio
npm install
cp config.example.json config.json
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `config.json` and `.env`, then:

```bash
npm run dev       # Daily brief (email + Telegram)
npm run intraday  # Intraday alert check (compares vs morning)
npm run weekly    # Weekly rebalancing report
npm run refresh -- SMH  # Re-analyze single ticker with after-hours price
npm test          # Unit tests (pure functions, no network)
npm run smoke     # Live API smoke tests (requires network + config.json)
```

## How It Works

```
CONFIG_JSON variable + GitHub Secrets
  → fetchPrices (Yahoo Finance: prices, P/E, 52w range, beta, dividends, ETF holdings, fundamentals, earnings calendar)
  → fetchTechnicals (Yahoo Finance chart: SMA50, SMA200, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Stochastic, OBV, momentum)
  → fetchNews (NewsAPI: top headlines per ticker + Gemini sentiment scoring)
  → analyze (allocation gaps, P/E signals, overlap discounts, portfolio metrics)
  → aiAnalyze (Gemini two-stage: Stage 1 Observe → Stage 2 Decide + reasoning history)
  → guards (post-AI validation: earnings guard, STRONG BUY criteria, bond cap, confidence sanity)
  → email + telegram (deliver daily brief with value ratings, bottom signals, technicals, earnings badges)
```

Weekly mode (`--weekly`) skips news and AI, producing a focused rebalancing report.

Intraday mode (`--intraday`) re-fetches prices, technicals, and AI (skipping news), compares against the morning baseline, and alerts only for STRONG BUY-related changes: upgrades to STRONG BUY, downgrades from STRONG BUY, or confidence shifts ≥10 while at STRONG BUY.

Refresh mode (`--refresh TICKER`) re-analyzes a single ticker using the latest available price (including after-hours/pre-market from Yahoo Finance). Outputs updated analysis to terminal and sends email + Telegram with a new analysis URL. Useful when you see an alert after market close and want an updated limit order based on after-hours price movement.

## Updating Your Portfolio

Update the `CONFIG_JSON` variable in GitHub Settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab). The next run will reflect the changes.
